	<!--commenting out the header <h1>Phillip Kerger</h1>-->
	<p>I am a PhD candidate at Johns Hopkins University in the department of Applied Mathematics and Statistcs, working under the supervision of Prof. 
		<a href="https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~abasu9/">Amitabh Basu</a>. I'm mostly interested in optimization and its applications, currently working
		on both classical and quantum algorithms and complexity. Difficult combinatorial problems, elegant algorithms with geometric interpretations, and how 
		we can take advantage of quantum mechanics for efficient computation really fascinate me.<br><br>
		I am currently working as a research intern at
		<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-quantum-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-quail/">NASA QuAIL</a> 
		through <a href = "https://www.usra.edu/"> USRA</a>
		under the supervision of <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/debernal/">Dr. David E Bernal Neira</a>
		and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2UvnS7UAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Eleanor Rieffel</a>, 
		with whom I am working on distributed quantum algorithms. <br><br>
		I love teaching, and have taught a few courses as the primary instructor at JHU. I am a teaching fellow of the department of Applied Math and Statistics there, 
		and have won multipe awards for my work as a teaching assistant at JHU. An overview of my teaching experience can be found 
		<a href="https://phillipkerger.github.io/teaching/">here</a>. <br><br>
		Before joining JHU, I completed my bachelor's degree in mathematics at Fordham University, where I had the great pleasure of working with
		<a href="https://www.fordham.edu/info/20597/mathematics_faculty/9444/kei_kobayashi">Kei Kobayashi</a>
		on parameter estimation for heavy-tailed stochastic processes.
