	<!--commenting out the header <h1>Phillip Kerger</h1>-->
	<p> I am an assistant teaching professor at UC Berkeley in the <a href="https://ieor.berkeley.edu/">Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research</a>. 
		I love teaching and am continuously aspiring to improve my methods.  An overview of my teaching experience can be found 
		<a href="https://phillipkerger.github.io/teaching/">here</a>.
		I did my PhD at Johns Hopkins University in Applied Mathematics, working under the wonderful Prof. 
		<a href="https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~abasu9/">Amitabh Basu</a>, during which I also received a few awards for my teaching there. On the research side, I'm mostly interested in optimization and its applications, and have focused my research
		on both classical and quantum algorithms and complexity. Difficult combinatorial problems, elegant algorithms with geometric interpretations, how 
		we can take advantage of quantum mechanics for computing, and the interplays across different fields of mathematics within optimization and machine learning fascinate me.<br><br>
		During my PhD, I spent my last two years also working as a research intern at
		<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-quantum-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-quail/">NASA QuAIL</a> 
		through <a href = "https://www.usra.edu/"> USRA</a>
		under the supervision of <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=286478">Dr. David E Bernal Neira</a>
		and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2UvnS7UAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Eleanor Rieffel</a>, 
		working on distributed quantum algorithms. <br><br>
		Before joining JHU, I completed my bachelor's degree in mathematics at Fordham University, where I had the great pleasure of working with
		<a href="https://www.fordham.edu/info/20597/mathematics_faculty/9444/kei_kobayashi">Kei Kobayashi</a>
		on parameter estimation for heavy-tailed stochastic processes.
		<br><br>
		I also play bass and guitar, and love playing and watching soccer.
