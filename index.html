	<!--commenting out the header <h1>Phillip Kerger</h1>-->
	<p> I am an incoming assistant teaching professor at UC Berkeley in the <a href="https://ieor.berkeley.edu/">Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research</a>. 
		I did my PhD at Johns Hopkins University in Applied Mathematics, working under the supervision of Prof. 
		<a href="https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~abasu9/">Amitabh Basu</a>. I'm mostly interested in optimization and its applications, and have focused my research
		on both classical and quantum algorithms and complexity. Difficult combinatorial problems, elegant algorithms with geometric interpretations, how 
		we can take advantage of quantum mechanics for computing, and the interplays across different fields of mathematics within optimization and machine learning fascinate me.<br><br>
		During my PhD, I spent my last two years also working as a research intern at
		<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-quantum-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-quail/">NASA QuAIL</a> 
		through <a href = "https://www.usra.edu/"> USRA</a>
		under the supervision of <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=286478">Dr. David E Bernal Neira</a>
		and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2UvnS7UAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Eleanor Rieffel</a>, 
		working on distributed quantum algorithms. <br><br>
		I love teaching, and have taught a multiple courses as the primary instructor at JHU. I am a teaching fellow of the department of Applied Math and Statistics there, 
		and have won multipe awards for my work as a teaching assistant at JHU. An overview of my teaching experience can be found 
		<a href="https://phillipkerger.github.io/teaching/">here</a>. <br><br>
		Before joining JHU, I completed my bachelor's degree in mathematics at Fordham University, where I had the great pleasure of working with
		<a href="https://www.fordham.edu/info/20597/mathematics_faculty/9444/kei_kobayashi">Kei Kobayashi</a>
		on parameter estimation for heavy-tailed stochastic processes.
		<br><br>
		I'm also a bassist, guitarist, and beginning drummer, and love playing soccer.
